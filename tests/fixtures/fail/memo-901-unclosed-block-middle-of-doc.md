## Analysis

This should FAIL: code block never closed.

### Unclosed Block

```python
def broken_function():
    return "This block is never closed"

The closing fence is missing!

```
def broken_function():
    return "This block is never closed"

The closing fence is missing again, so we have a balanced set but the document is not well formed according to the author.
